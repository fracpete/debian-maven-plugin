      * added <<<attach>>> option to attach artifact (pull request #6 from kh31d4r/master)

* 1.0.22

      * default <<<compressionType>>> is now <<<gzip>>> (not <<<gz>>>). Added <<<sysdefault>>> to use whatever

      * with <<<compressionType>>> the default compression type of <<<gz>>>

      []

* 1.0.20

      * the current artifact now gets included as well: this artifact's scope
        is <<<null>>> and was therefore excluded since the set generated from
        <<<includedScope>>> does not contain <<<null>>>.

      []

* 1.0.19

      * added <<<includeScope>>> and <<<excludeScope>>> properties to fine-tune
        the scope of artifacts to include.

      []

* 1.0.18

      * using <<<simple-maven-file-filtering>>> library now for file filtering.

      []

* 1.0.17

      * copying of resources no longer fails if parent directory of output exists,
        e.g., when copying a script into <<<target/deb/usr/bin>>> when
        <<<target/deb/usr/bin>>> does not exist yet.

      []

* 1.0.16

      * <<<useDefaultCopyResources>>> now works with multi-module projects as well
        ({{https://github.com/fracpete/debian-maven-plugin/issues/1}})

      []

* 1.0.15

      * improved/fixed logging output related to file filtering.

      []

* 1.0.14

      * when <<<useDefaultCopyResources>>> is enabled but <<<src/deb/resources>>>
        does not exist, then a warning is output rather than failing with an
        exception when attempting to copy ({{https://github.com/fracpete/debian-maven-plugin/issues/3}}).

      []

* 1.0.13

      * added support for file filtering (ie replacing of variables in text files),
        disabled by default ({{https://github.com/fracpete/debian-maven-plugin/issues/2}}).

      []

* 1.0.12

      * attached artifacts are now subjected to checks against includes/excludes as well.

      * added support for copying resources (directories or files) directly, without
        having to rely on the <<<copy-resources>>> goal of <<<maven-resources-plugin>>>.
        this is achieve with the <<<useDefaultCopyResources>>> and <<<copyResources>>>
        parameters.

      * added support for fixing file permissions directly rather than relying
        the <<<chmod>>> task of the <<<maven-antrun-plugin>>> plugin. this is
        achieve by using the <<<useDefaultFixPermissions>>> and <<<fixPermissions>>>
        parameters.

      * added <<<skip>>> parameter, which can be used in top-level pom modules
        of multi-module projects to skip the execution of the plugin.

      []

* 1.0.11

      * introduced <<<libDirectory>>> parameter, to allow changing the directory
        with the jars; default is <<</usr/lib/\{PKGNAME\}>>>, but one can change it
        to <<</opt/\{PKGNAME\}/lib>>> with this parameter.

      * introduced <<<docDirectory>>> parameter, to allow changing the directory
        with the documentation; default is <<</usr/share/doc/\{PKGNAME\}>>>, but one can change it
        to <<</opt/\{PKGNAME\}/doc>>> with this parameter.

      * introduced <<<manDirectory>>> parameter, to allow changing the directory
        with the man pages; default is <<</usr/share/man>>>, but one can change it
        to <<</opt/\{PKGNAME\}/man>>> with this parameter.

      * introduced <<<createSymLinks>>> parameter, to allow turning off symbolic
        link generation for jar files (without the artifact version).

      * introduced <<<createIncludeFiles>>> parameter, to allow turning off creation
        of .inc files for artifacts.
